## Bipartite

A graph that can be colored using 2 colors only such that no two adjacent nodes have same color.

- Graphs with no odd length cycle


- When we need to check if a node is present in the graph or not, we can use map instead of a vector

```cpp
  map<string,vector<pair<string,double>>> m;
```
