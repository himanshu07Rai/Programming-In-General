# Linked List

A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, i.e., it can be traversed in only one direction from the head to the last node (tail).

Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the ​next node, which helps to maintain​ the structure of the list.

The head is a pointer that points to the first node of the list and, hence, helps us traverse the list. The last node (also referred to as the tail) points to NULL, which helps us in determining when the list ends.

The datatype of head is Node( self refrancing structure ), because it is pointing to the whole node in heap and not only to the data in Node.
